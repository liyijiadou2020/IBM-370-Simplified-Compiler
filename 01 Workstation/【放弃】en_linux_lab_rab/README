1. This kit, consisting of three elements of an educational programming system
and test task:
     - PL/1 compiler --> Assembler (komppl.c),
     - assembler compiler --> object image (kompassr.c),
     - absolute loader, emulator and debugger (absloadm.c),
     - test task ( examppl.pli and spismod ).
    
2. To obtain executable modules of two compilers and an absolute loader
you should run the GenSysProgr Bash script.

3. After receiving the executable code, compilers can be launched for execution
test case using Bash script StartTestTask.
